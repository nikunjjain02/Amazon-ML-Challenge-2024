# Amazon ML Challenge 2024 - Solution

This repository contains my solution for the **Amazon ML Challenge 2024**, where I ranked in the **top 200** out of thousands of participants with an accuracy of around **45%**.

## Solution Approach

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Utilized **PaddleOCR** for text extraction and recognition tasks in the dataset.
- Used the **RE (regular expressions)** library of Python for advanced text processing and pattern matching.

### Evaluation Metrics
- The primary metric for evaluation was **accuracy**, with a final score of **45%**.

## Files and Folders

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the solution workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.
- `data/`: Sample datasets (not the full competition data due to confidentiality).
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Results and Ranking

- **Rank**: Top 200
- **Accuracy**: 45%

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the Amazon ML Challenge team for organizing the competition, as well as the online machine learning communities that provided resources and support.
